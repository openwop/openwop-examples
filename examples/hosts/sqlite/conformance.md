# Conformance Result: openwop SQLite Reference Host

> **Latest measurement:** **2026-06-11 (post-fix re-run) against `@openwop/openwop-conformance@1.22.0` — 1826 passed / 0 failed / 137 skipped / 0 todo of 1963 tests (93.0%) — 0 deterministic failures** (strict mode + the soak gate's honest profile/fixture opt-outs, which now include `openwop-grpc-transport`/`openwop-i18n`; full 82-fixture catalog resolved via the new `OPENWOP_FIXTURES_DIR` override — no symlinks). The 2 real RFC 0093 §A3 `webhook-tenant-isolation` failures from the same-day measurement below are **closed**: the host now enforces the registration-time tenant-membership gate (403 `tenant_membership_required` on a foreign `tenantId`, tenant-scoped `DELETE` with no existence leak, tenant-filtered delivery fan-out) — `webhook-tenant-isolation.test.ts` passes 4/4 non-vacuously.

> **Prior measurement (superseded same-day by the webhook-tenant-gate fix):** **2026-06-11 against `@openwop/openwop-conformance@1.22.0` — 1820 passed / 6 failed / 137 skipped / 0 todo of 1963 tests (92.7%)** (strict mode + honest profile/fixture opt-outs; cross-host re-measurement in `INTEROP-MATRIX.md`). The 6 failures decompose honestly: 4 are strict-mode `behaviorGate` failures for the new 1.22.0 profiles this host does not claim (`openwop-grpc-transport`, `openwop-i18n` — the soak gate's opt-out list gains them in the spec repo), and **2 are real**: the new RFC 0093 §A3 `webhook-tenant-isolation.test.ts` — this host advertises `webhooks.supported: true` but lacks a registration-time tenant-membership gate (genuine gap on an advertised surface; fix tracked). **Measurement-basis note:** this run loads the full 82-fixture catalog (prior readings ran with degraded fixture loading — the host's upward fixture probe only finds the catalog when nested inside the spec repo), so passed/skipped deltas vs 1.21.0 reflect broader coverage.

Holds the 0-failure posture against 1.21.0; the 3 new RFC 0090/0091/0092 always-on probes (`verifier-gating`/`callai-multimodal`/`agent-capability-degraded`) are opted out as unclaimed profiles per the soak gate.

The current published suite is `1.19.0`; its sole addition (the RFC 0082 §B `agent-channel-dispatch` scenario) is capability-gated on `agents.deployment` and **soft-skips** here. Holds the 0-failure posture; total rose 2086 → 2161 as the v1.11–v1.18.1 scenarios (RFCs 0078–0083 + memory-degraded-projection + OTel collector-canary-inspection + budget + agent-platform aggregate-evidence + SAML) landed. The TypeScript SDK `dist/` was built first so the server-free corpus-validity scenarios pass. See `INTEROP-MATRIX.md` §"External conformance suite — pass rates".

The previously-recorded 7 failures are all closed: RFC 0022 dispatch input/output mapping (× 4) is now implemented in the executor (`mockDispatchPlan` supervisor-mock + sequential multi-worker dispatch with all four mapping fields + `core.subWorkflow` `inputMapping`), RFC 0026 cost-attribution (× 2) landed earlier, and the RFC 0031 `model.capability.insufficient` refusal (× 1) is now wired end-to-end.

## Summary

Against the live SQLite host (`npm start` from `examples/hosts/sqlite/`):

- **Test files:** 140 total (post-soak-gate close-out — suite grew with RFC 0013 workflow-chain-packs, RFC 0022 dispatch mapping, audit-tamper scenarios, etc.).
- **Tests (strict-mode, `OPENWOP_REQUIRE_BEHAVIOR=true` + opt-out envs):** **1216 passing / 0 failing / 55 skipped / 7 todo** (2026-05-19, against suite `@openwop/openwop-conformance@1.2.0`). Required envs for a green run: `OPENWOP_OPTED_OUT_PROFILES=openwop-production,openwop-auth-oauth2-client-credentials,openwop-auth-oidc-user-bearer,openwop-auth-mtls,openwop-replay-fork,workflowChainPacks` + `OPENWOP_OPTED_OUT_FIXTURES=conformance-dispatch-input-mapping*,conformance-dispatch-output-mapping*,conformance-dispatch-cross-worker-handoff*,conformance-subworkflow-input-mapping*` + `OPENWOP_OPTED_OUT_SCENARIOS=otel-trace-propagation-subworkflow`. The 55 skips break down as: profile-opt-outs (this host doesn't claim production, OAuth2-CC, OIDC, mTLS, replay-fork, workflow-chain-packs), fixture-opt-outs (RFC 0022 §A/§B variable projection not implemented in the reference executor), and one scenario-opt-out (traceparent doesn't thread the `core.subWorkflow` dispatch boundary). **(Superseded 2026-05-25: RFC 0022 §A/§B variable projection is now implemented, so the `OPENWOP_OPTED_OUT_FIXTURES=conformance-dispatch-*` / `conformance-subworkflow-input-mapping*` opt-outs are no longer required — those fixtures now pass.)**
- **Test command (mirrors `.github/workflows/conformance-soak.yml`):**
  ```
  OPENWOP_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3838 OPENWOP_API_KEY=openwop-sqlite-dev-key \
    OPENWOP_REQUIRE_BEHAVIOR=true \

    OPENWOP_OPTED_OUT_SCENARIOS='otel-trace-propagation-subworkflow' \
    npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism
  ```
- **RFC 0011 auth-scoped discovery (verified end-to-end 2026-05-12):** With `OPENWOP_TENANT2_API_KEY` configured, the host returns three views — unauthenticated + primary (6 capability keys: `auth`, `discovery`, `dispatch`, `orchestrator`, `secrets`, `webhooks`) vs tenant2 (4 keys: `auth`, `discovery`, `secrets`, `webhooks`). Tenant2's keyset is a strict subset of primary's, satisfying the no-authorization-oracle invariant from `capabilities-change-detection.md` §"Scoped capability views" line 69. All 3 RFC 0011 subtests in `discovery.test.ts` pass under `OPENWOP_REQUIRE_BEHAVIOR=true` + `OPENWOP_TEST_UNAUTHORIZED_API_KEY=<tenant2-key>`.
- **RFC 0010 auth-profile rotation (verified end-to-end 2026-05-12):** Two-key overlap via `OPENWOP_SECONDARY_API_KEY`; constant-time dual-candidate `checkAuth`; canary-redaction confirmed. `auth-api-key-rotation.test.ts` passes 3/3 under behavior mode.

Net result vs the in-memory host (which claims only `openwop-core` + stream profiles): SQLite adds the durability surface plus 7 optional profile claims, each verified end-to-end through the conformance suite or host-internal tests.

## What this host adds over in-memory

| Property | In-memory | SQLite |
|---|---|---|
| Run state survives process restart | ❌ | ✅ |
| Events survive process restart | ❌ | ✅ |
| Claim acquisition for cross-process safety | N/A | ✅ |
| Idempotency cache survives restart | ❌ | ✅ |
| Total LOC | ~570 | ~700 |
| External dependencies | 0 | 1 (`better-sqlite3`) |

The SQLite host is the cheapest possible proof of "I can replace the storage layer without changing the wire contract." It is also a durable OpenWOP host with a different storage backend from the in-memory example, addressing the interoperability ask for a non-trivial backend.

## Failure classification

| Category | Files | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| **Out-of-profile (expected)** | `cap-breach`, `channel-ttl`, `subworkflow`, `replay-fork`, `interrupt-*`, `pack-registry`, `runtime-capabilities`, `identity-passthrough` | Host doesn't claim the gating profile. Adding the corresponding feature would lift the host's profile claim. |
| **Within-profile gaps** | `version-negotiation`, `stream-modes-buffer`, `stream-modes-mixed`, partial `stream-modes` | Same gaps as in-memory host: event-shape `seq` vs `eventId+sequence`; SSE buffering / array `streamMode` parameter handling. |

## Reproducing this result

# Terminal 1
cd examples/hosts/sqlite
npm install
npm start

# Terminal 2 (from repo root)

```

## Comparison with in-memory host

The in-memory host (`examples/hosts/in-memory/`) and SQLite host run nearly the same code path at the wire level. The differences:

- **SQLite passes `eventOrdering` repeated-poll stability** with stronger evidence — events come from the durable log every read, not from process-local state.
- **SQLite advertises `debugBundle.supported: true`** like the in-memory host; their bundle responses share the same shape contract.
- **SQLite's idempotency cache survives restart**; the in-memory cache doesn't. The `staleClaim` scenario exercises the stop-restart-resume path for claim recovery.

The within-profile gaps are identical because both hosts share the same `seq` field naming choice. Closing them in one host should close them in both.

## Stale-claim recovery (live)

`staleClaim.test.ts` passes against this host. The scenario spawns process A pointing at a temp DB, starts a long-running run, SIGKILLs A, waits for the claim to expire, then spawns process B pointing at the same DB. B's resume-on-startup re-acquires the claim and finishes the run. The event log shows `run.started` (from A) followed by `run.resumed` (from B) followed by the rest of the run's lifecycle.

Run it manually:

```bash
OPENWOP_RUN_STALE_CLAIM=1 \
  OPENWOP_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9999 OPENWOP_API_KEY=irrelevant \
  npx vitest run src/scenarios/staleClaim.test.ts
```

(The `OPENWOP_BASE_URL` + `OPENWOP_API_KEY` env vars are required by the conformance suite's standard driver but are not used by this scenario — it spawns its own host processes.)

Typical wall-clock: ~5–8 seconds. The dominant cost is the 5-second `core.delay` re-execution on host B; the spec says nothing about Layer-2 idempotency, so the reference example re-runs the delay from scratch. Production hosts with Layer-2 dedup would skip the already-completed sub-steps.

## Known v1.x Expansion Candidates

1. ~~**Resume-on-startup.**~~ ✅ Live as of 2026-05-01.
2. ~~**Heartbeat renewal.**~~ ✅ Live as of 2026-05-01.
3. ~~**Audit-log integrity profile.**~~ ✅ Live as of 2026-05-11. Hash-chained `audit_log` table + Ed25519-signed `audit_checkpoints`; `GET /v1/audit/verify` reports `chainValid` + anomalies. Wiring under `src/audit.ts`.
4. ~~**HITL interrupts + four optional profiles.**~~ ✅ Live as of 2026-05-11 (T1.2 commits A–D). `core.approvalGate` / `core.clarificationGate` / `core.interrupt` / `core.subWorkflow` node types; `POST /v1/runs/{runId}/interrupts/{nodeId}` + `POST /v1/interrupts/{token}` resolve routes; `interrupts` table with hash-chain'd vote ledger; parent/child cascade via `parent_run_id` linkage. Wiring under `src/interrupts.ts`.
5. **Postgres adapter.** Same schema, swap the DB driver, gain horizontal scale-out. Filed as a future row in `INTEROP-MATRIX.md`.
4. **Multi-tenancy.** Add `tenant_id` to every table + composite primary keys. Currently single hardcoded tenant.
5. **Layer-2 idempotency** for non-pure nodes. The reference example only ships pure nodes (`core.noop`, `core.delay`); a fork that adds `core.ai.callPrompt` MUST persist invocation results to dedupe on resume.
